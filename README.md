# E-Commerce-Sales-Analysis-Dashboard-


Hey there!

This is a project I recently worked on to explore sales data from an e-commerce business and turn it into a clear, insightful dashboard using Power BI.

What This Dashboard Shows:
	•	Total sales of $12.64M with $1.47M in profit
	•	Performance across categories like Technology, Furniture, and Office Supplies
	•	Regional insights from US, EU, APAC, LATAM, and EMEA
	•	Breakdown by shipping modes and top-performing countries
	•	State-wise sales performance and quantity shipped

Why I Built This:

I wanted to strengthen my Power BI skills by diving into real-world data. This project helped me understand how to:
	•	Clean and model data effectively
	•	Create interactive visuals and KPIs
	•	Tell a story with data that actually makes sense to stakeholders

Tools I Used:
	•	Power BI Desktop
	•	DAX for custom measures
	•	Slicers, cards, maps, and charts for visual storytelling
